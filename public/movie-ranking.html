<p>amazing plot which emphasis on the idea that "We all are main characters of our own story ,but our story isn't the main story " Really artistic.</p>

<p>Only thing I have to say is "You are not the contents of your wallets , you are not your Khakis YOU ARE THE ALL SINGING ALL DANCING <b>CRAP OF THE WORLD</b>".</p>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>

<p>At first I thought that this movie was about humility forgiveness and how people change with time. But at the end it went boggers</p>
